# Android Espresso Tests

Welcome to the Android automation section of my repo! Here, you'll find UI tests for an Android app using **Espresso**. Feel free to explore, run the tests, or contribute!

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository
* Open the project in Android Studio and let it sync the dependencies.
* You can run the tests directly from Android Studio or via the command line
   
## Notes:
* Make sure you have the Android SDK installed and configured properly.
* The project should be good to go with all dependencies pre-configured!
